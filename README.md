# London-Congestion-Zone
Applied Microeconometrics Project â€” UniversitÃ© de NeuchÃ¢tel (2023)

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project analyzes the **impact of the London Congestion Charging Zone (CCZ) policy** on traffic accidents using **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** methodology.

The CCZ was implemented to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and enhance road safety. Our analysis evaluates whether the policy also led to measurable changes in road accident rates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Assess the causal effect of the CCZ on the number of traffic accidents.
- Investigate potential **spillover effects** in surrounding non-treated areas.
- Test robustness using alternative model specifications.

## ðŸ“Š Data
We used panel data from:
- **Accident statistics** from the UK Department for Transport.
- **Geographic classification** of treated (inside CCZ) vs. control (outside CCZ) areas.
- Pre- and post-policy implementation accident counts.

**Period covered:** Multiple years before and after the CCZ introduction.

## ðŸ›  Methodology
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** approach to estimate treatment effects.
- Pre-treatment trend analysis to verify the **parallel trends assumption**.
- Robustness checks including:
  - Alternative control groups.
  - Inclusion of time-varying covariates.
  - Spillover effect tests.

**Key Equation:**
\[
Accidents_{it} = \alpha + \beta (Treated_i \times Post_t) + \gamma_i + \delta_t + \epsilon_{it}
\]
Where:
- \( Treated_i \) = 1 if area is within CCZ, 0 otherwise.
- \( Post_t \) = 1 after policy implementation, 0 before.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Significant reduction in the number of traffic accidents **inside the CCZ** after implementation.
- **Spillover effects**: Slight increases in surrounding areas, possibly due to traffic diversion.
- Robustness checks confirm the main findings.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Figures
- **Figure 1:** Pre-treatment parallel trends.
- **Figure 2:** Estimated treatment effects.
- **Figure 3:** Spillover effect analysis.

## ðŸ’¡ Conclusions
The London Congestion Charging Zone appears effective not only in reducing congestion but also in improving **road safety** within the treated area. Policymakers should, however, consider mitigation strategies for spillover effects in nearby regions.
